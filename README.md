# Sign Language Letter Recognition using YOLO

## Project Overview:
This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to predict sign language gestures and their corresponding meanings as letters. The primary goal is to create an accurate and efficient model for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) letters in real-time. By leveraging YOLO's capabilities, the model aims to provide swift and precise predictions, making it suitable for applications like assistive technology and educational tools for the hearing-impaired.

## Dataset Description:
The model is trained on a comprehensive   puplic dataset of American Sign Language letters, which can be found here or (https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/american-sign-language-letters/1). The dataset consists of annotated images containing ASL hand gestures representing individual letters. Each image is labeled with bounding boxes around the hand gestures, specifying the region of interest for training the YOLO model. The dataset diversity ensures robustness and adaptability to various signing styles.

## Key Features:

YOLO-based object detection for real-time inference.
Multi-class classification for recognizing ASL letters.
Efficient and accurate bounding box predictions.
Model trained on a diverse dataset for enhanced generalization.


## Contributing:
Contributions to improve the model's accuracy, speed, and generalization are welcome.
